/*
 * Problems:
 * - this version of stm32ide does now come with proper support for gdb - the only thing to do then is use a local tool chain
 * - this can be done by going to window > preferences - a window appears
 * - in the search bar type tool chain manager - you should see a side bar menu under stm32cube
 * - click on add local
 * Assuming you already have arm-none-eabi installed, open a terminal and run which arm-none-eabi-gcc to get its location. Here it is under /usr/bin.
 * On the Toolchain Manager, click “Add Local…” button on the right, give it some name, leave the default arm-none-eabi- prefix as it is,
 * then fill the Location with the location of your arm-none-eabi-* (possibly /usr/bin/). Click on Finish.
 * Back on the Toolchain Manager, select the toolchain you’ve just added and click the “Set Default” button on the right.
 *
 * GOTCHA:
 * - this might also be that the arm-none-eabi- expects a gdb - you probably have gdb-multiarch installed
 * - now all is needed is to link it like so:
 * `ln -s /usr/bin/gdb-multiarch /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb`
